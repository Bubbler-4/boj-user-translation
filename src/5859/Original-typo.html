				<p>After spending so much time around his cows, Farmer John has started to understand their language.  Moreover, he notices that among his N cows (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000), some always tell the truth while others always lie.</p>



<p>FJ carefully listens to M statements (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 10,000) from his cows, each of the form &quot;x y T&quot;, meaning that &quot;cow x claims cow y always tells the truth&quot; or &quot;x y L&quot;, meaning that &quot;cow x claims cow y always tells lies&quot;. Each statement involves a pair of different cows, and the same pair of cows may appear in multiple statements.  </p>



<p>Unfortunately, FJ believes he might have written down some entries in his list incorrectly, so there may not be a valid way to designate each cow as a truth teller or a liar that is consistent with all the M statements on FJ&#39;s list.  To help FJ salvage as much of his list as possible, please compute the largest value of A such that there exists a valid way to designate each cow as a truth teller or a liar in a manner that is consistent with the first A entries in FJ&#39;s list.</p>

				<p>Statements 1 and 3 cannot both be satisfied at the same time, but statements 1 and 2 can be, if we let cows 1..3 tell the truth and cow 4 be a liar.</p>
