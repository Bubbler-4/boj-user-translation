				<p>You are steering a boat from the coordinates (-10,&nbsp;A) to the coordinates (10,&nbsp;B). The coordinates are measured in kilometers, and your boat travels at a constant speed of 1 kilometer per hour. You have full control over the path the boat takes. We model the boat as a single point.</p>



<p>There are&nbsp;N&nbsp;islands in the area; we model them as single points. The i-th island is at the coordinates (0,&nbsp;C<sub>i</sub>).</p>



<p>The area is radioactive, and you constantly receive 1 microsievert per hour of radiation from the general environment, no matter where you are. Moreover, the islands themselves are radioactive, and you constantly receive additional radiation at a rate of (D<sub>i</sub>)<sup>-2</sup>microsieverts per hour from the i-th island, where D<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;is your current distance (in kilometers) from the i-th island. (Formally: let D<sub>i</sub>(t) be your distance from the i-th island as a function of time t, and X be the total time your journey takes. Then the total radiation received from the i-th island is the definite integral from 0 to X of D<sub>i</sub>(t)<sup>-2</sup>.) You can get as close to an island as you would like, as long as you do not match its exact coordinates.</p>



<p>Find the minimum total radiation dose that you can receive if you plot your course optimally.</p>

					<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,&nbsp;T;&nbsp;T&nbsp;test cases follow. Each test cases consists of two lines. The first line of a test case consists of three values: an integer&nbsp;N, and two floating-point numbers&nbsp;A&nbsp;and&nbsp;B, as described in the statement above. The second line of a test case consists of&nbsp;N&nbsp;floating-point numbers&nbsp;C<sub>i</sub>; the i-th of these numbers gives the y coordinate of the i-th island.</p>



<p>All floating-point numbers are specified to exactly two decimal places.</p>

				<p>Here is a diagram of the optimal path for sample case #1. We have enlarged the island to make it more visible, but remember to treat it as a single point.</p>
